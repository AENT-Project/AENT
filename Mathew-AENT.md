The Gospel Of Matthew
A Friendly, Plain American English Translation 
(AENT) Accessible English New Testament
This version is written for everyone. We use familiar names like "Jesus" and "God" rather than the original Aramaic or Hebrew names (like Y'shua or God) because our goal is to make the Bible easy to read and understand. This translation focuses on making the meaning clear so you can understand what was actually being said.
A quick tip for the reader: Whenever you see "THE LORD" in all capital letters, it refers to the personal, sacred name of God. When you see "Lord" in normal letters, it is usually a title of respect, similar to calling someone "Sir" or "Master."

The Lineage of Jesus the Messiah
This is the record of the family line of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David and the son of Abraham.
Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac was the father of Jacob, and Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers. Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah (their mother was Tamar), Perez was the father of Hezron, and Hezron was the father of Ram. Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab was the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon was the father of Salmon. Salmon was the father of Boaz (his mother was Rahab), Boaz was the father of Obed (his mother was Ruth), and Obed was the father of Jesse. Jesse was the father of David, the King.
David the King was the father of Solomon (whose mother had been Uriah’s wife). Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam was the father of Abijah, and Abijah was the father of Asa. Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram, and Joram was the father of Uzziah. Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham was the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah. Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh was the father of Amon, and Amon was the father of Josiah. Josiah was the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the forced move to Babylon.
After the move to Babylon, Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel. Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud, Abiud was the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim was the father of Azor. Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok was the father of Achim, and Achim was the father of Eliud. Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar was the father of Matthan, and Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and she was the one who gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
So, there were fourteen generations in total from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the Babylonian exile, and fourteen generations from the Babylonian exile to the Messiah.
The Birth of Jesus the Messiah
This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah happened. His mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together as husband and wife, she became pregnant through the Holy Spirit.
Joseph, her husband-to-be, was a man of high integrity. He didn't want to disgrace her publicly, so he decided to break off the engagement quietly. While he was thinking this over, an angel of THE LORD appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. The child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus (which means ‘Salvation’), because he is the one who will save his people from their sins.”
All of this took place to fulfill what THE LORD had said through the prophet: “Look! The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel,” which means “God is with us.”
When Joseph woke up, he did exactly what the angel of THE LORD commanded him and took Mary as his wife. But he did not have intimate relations with her until she gave birth to her son. And he named the boy Jesus.

The Visit of the Wise Men
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the land of Judah, during the time when Herod was king, some wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem. They asked, “Where is the baby who has been born to be the King of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose in the east, and we have come to honor him.”
When King Herod heard this, he was deeply disturbed, and so was everyone else in Jerusalem. He called a meeting of all the high priests and the religious scholars of the people. He asked them exactly where the Messiah was supposed to be born.
They told him, “In Bethlehem, in the land of Judah. The prophet wrote about it:
‘Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, you are certainly not the least important among the towns of Judah. A leader will come from you who will shepherd my people, the people of Israel.’” 
Then Herod called the wise men to a private meeting. He found out from them the exact time the star had first appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, come back and tell me, so that I can go and honor him too.”
After they heard the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped right over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they were filled with huge, overwhelming joy.
They went into the house and saw the child with his mother, Mary. They bowed down and honored him. Then they opened their treasure chests and gave him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. But because they were warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by a different route.
The Escape to Egypt
After the wise men left, an angel of THE LORD appeared to Joseph in a dream. The angel said, “Get up! Take the child and his mother and run away to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, because Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and left for Egypt. He stayed there until Herod died. This fulfilled what THE LORD had said through the prophet: “I called my son out of Egypt.”
When Herod realized the wise men had outsmarted him, he flew into a rage. He sent soldiers to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and the surrounding area who were two years old and under. This matched the timeframe he had learned from the wise men.
This fulfilled what the prophet Jeremiah had said: “A voice was heard in Ramah, there will be crying and loud mourning. It was Rachel crying for her children. She refused to be comforted, because they were gone forever.”
The Return to Nazareth
After Herod died, an angel of THE LORD appeared in a dream to Joseph while he was still in Egypt. The angel said, “Get up! Take the child and his mother and go back to the land of Israel. Those who were trying to kill the child are dead.”
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and entered the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judah in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in another dream, he went to the region of Galilee instead.
He went and lived in a town called Nazareth. This fulfilled what the prophets had said: “He will be called a Nazarene.”

John the Baptist
In those days, John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness of Judah, preaching to the people. He said, "Turn away from your sins and change your life, because the Kingdom of Heaven is here!"
John is the one the prophet Isaiah was talking about when he said: "A voice is calling out in the desert, 'Clear the way for THE LORD! Make a straight path for him!'"
John wore clothes made of camel hair with a leather belt around his waist. He lived on a diet of locusts and wild honey. People from Jerusalem, all of Judah, and the whole region around the Jordan River went out to see him. When they admitted their sins, he baptized (immersed) them in the Jordan River.
But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing people, he said to them: "You bunch of snakes! Who warned you to run away from the coming judgment? If you have really changed your lives, show it by the way you live. Don't think you can say to yourselves, 'We are safe because Abraham is our father.' I’m telling you, God can turn these very stones into children for Abraham! “Even now, the axe is ready to cut the trees at their roots. Every life that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.” 
I baptize you in water to show you have turned from your sins. But someone is coming after me who is much more powerful than I am. I’m not even worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire. He has his sorting shovel in his hand, and he will completely clear out his dividing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but he will burn up the useless husks with a fire that never fades."
The Baptism of Jesus
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River so that John could baptize him. But John tried to stop him, saying, "I’m the one who needs to be baptized by you! Why are you coming to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be this way for now. It is right for us to do this to fulfill everything that is written." Then John agreed and baptized him.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. Suddenly, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice spoke from heaven, saying, "This is my Son, whom I love; I am very pleased with him."

The Testing of Jesus
Then the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tested by the Evil One. After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he was very hungry. The Tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God (God), tell these stones to become loaves of bread."
But Jesus answered, "It is written: 'A person does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of THE LORD.'"
Then the Accuser took him to the set-apart city of Jerusalem and stood him on the highest point of the Temple. "If you are the Son of God," he said, "jump off! For it is written: 'He will put his angels in charge of you, and they will catch you in their hands so you won't even stub your toe on a stone.'"
Jesus said to him, "It is also written: 'Do not put THE LORD your God to the test.'"
Again, the Accuser took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. He said, "I will give you all of this if you will just bow down and worship me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Get out of here, Satan! For it is written: 'You shall worship THE LORD your God, and serve only Him.'"
Then the Evil One left him, and suddenly, angels came and took care of his needs.
Jesus Begins His Work in Galilee
When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he went back to Galilee. He left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum, a town by the lake in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali. This happened to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had said:
“The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, along the sea road and beyond the Jordan, Galilee where many nations live — the people who were living in darkness have seen a great light. Those who were living in the land of death’s shadow now have light shining on them.”
From that time on, Jesus began to preach, saying, "Turn away from your sins, because the Kingdom of Heaven is right here!"
The First Disciples
As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the lake because they were fishermen. Jesus said to them, "Come, follow me, and I will show you how to fish for people." Right away, they left their nets and followed him.
Going on from there, he saw two other brothers: James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat with their father, Zebedee, fixing their nets. Jesus called them, and they immediately left the boat and their father and followed him.
Healing the Crowds
Jesus went all over Galilee, teaching in the synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and sickness among the people. News about him spread all the way to Syria. People brought to him everyone who was suffering from various diseases, those in great pain, those possessed by demons, those having seizures, and the paralyzed—and he healed them all. Large crowds followed him from Galilee, from Jerusalem and all of Judah, and from the lands of the Ten Cities across the Jordan River.

The Gospel Of Matthew Chapter 5


The Sermon on the Mount: The Beatitudes
When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them, saying:
"Blessed are those who are poor in spirit, because the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them.
Blessed are those who mourn, because they will be comforted.
Blessed are the humble, because they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, because they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, because they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, because they will see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, because they will be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for doing what is right, because the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them.
Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil things against you because of me. Be happy and glad! Your reward in heaven is great. That is exactly how they persecuted the prophets who came before you."
Salt and Light
"You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its taste, how can it be made salty again? It’s no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and walked on by people.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden. People don’t light a lamp and then hide it under a bucket. Instead, they put it on a stand so it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine in front of others, so they can see the good things you do and give glory to your Father in heaven."
Jesus and the Law
"Don't think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I didn't come to destroy them, but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth: until heaven and earth pass away, not even the smallest letter or the tiniest stroke of a pen will disappear from The Law until everything is accomplished.
So, whoever breaks even the smallest of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called 'least' in the Kingdom of Heaven. But whoever obeys them and teaches them will be called 'great' in the Kingdom of Heaven. I’m telling you, unless your righteousness is greater than that of the religious scholars and the Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven."
Anger and Relationships
"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder,' and 'Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother without a reason will be subject to judgment. Anyone who says to his brother, 'You empty-headed fool' will answer to the high council. And anyone who only says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.
So if you are offering your gift at the altar and remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and make things right with your brother, and then come back and offer your gift.
Settle matters quickly with your adversary while you are still on the way to court. Otherwise, your adversary might hand you over to the judge, the judge to the guard, and you’ll be thrown into prison. I tell you the truth, you won't get out until you have paid every last penny."
Adultery and Purity
"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It’s better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into Gehenna. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It’s better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into Gehenna."
Divorce
"It was also said, 'Whoever divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce.' But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife—unless she has been unfaithful—causes her to become an adulteress, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery."
Oaths and Integrity
"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the vows you have made to THE LORD.' But I tell you, don't swear at all: not by heaven, because it is God’s throne; not by the earth, because it is His footstool; and not by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Great King. Don't even swear by your own head, because you can't make one hair white or black. Just let your 'Yes' be 'Yes' and your 'No' be 'No.' Anything more than this comes from the Evil One."
Love for Enemies
"You have heard it said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I tell you, don't resist an evil person. If someone slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other one to them as well. If someone wants to sue you for your shirt, let them have your coat too. If someone forces you to go one mile, go two miles with them. Give to the person who asks you, and don't turn away from someone who wants to borrow from you.
You have heard it said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you. This way, you will be acting like true sons of your Father in heaven. He makes His sun rise on both the evil and the good, and sends rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous.
If you only love those who love you, what reward do you get? Even the tax collectors do that! And if you are only kind to your brothers, what are you doing that is so special? Even the pagans do that. So be complete in love, just as your heavenly Father is complete in love."

Doing Good in Secret
"Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of people just to be seen by them. If you do, you won’t have any reward from your Father in heaven.
So, when you give to the poor, don't blow a trumpet to announce it, like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be praised by others. I tell you the truth, they have already received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."
Prayer and the Model Prayer
"And when you pray, don't be like the hypocrites. They love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your private room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
When you pray, don't babble on and on like the pagans do. They think they will be heard because of their many words. Don't be like them, because your Father knows exactly what you need before you even ask Him. This, then, is how you should pray:
Our Father in heaven,
May Your Name be kept holy.
May Your Kingdom come.
May Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And do not lead us into trial, but deliver us from the Evil One.
For if you forgive others when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."
Fasting
"When you fast, don't look miserable like the hypocrites. They neglect their appearance so people will notice they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it won't be obvious to others that you are fasting. Only your Father, who is in secret, will know. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."
True Wealth and the Eye
"Don't store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moths and rust destroy them, and where thieves break in and steal. Instead, store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal. For where your treasure is, that is where your heart will be also.
The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eye is healthy (generous), your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is ill (greedy), your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is actually darkness, how great is that darkness!"
Serving Two Masters
"No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money."
Do Not Worry
"This is why I tell you: do not worry about your life, or what you will eat and drink, or about your body, or what you will wear. Isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds in the sky; they don't sow or reap or store food in barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you much more valuable than they are? Can any of you, by worrying, add a single hour to your life?
And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They don't work or spin thread. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed as beautifully as one of these. If God clothes the grass of the field like that, which is here today and thrown into the oven tomorrow, won't He much more clothe you, you of little faith?
So don't worry, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?' For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."

Judging Others
"Do not judge, so that you won’t be judged. For the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and the standard you use to measure others will be used to measure you.
Why do you look at the tiny speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye, but you don't notice the giant log in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take that speck out of your eye,' when there is a whole log in yours? You hypocrite! First, take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly enough to remove the speck from your brother’s eye."
Sacred Things
"Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls in front of pigs. If you do, they will just trample them under their feet and then turn around and tear you to pieces."
Ask, Seek, Knock
"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you then, as imperfect as you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!"
The Golden Rule
"So in everything, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is the essence of the Law and the Prophets."
The Two Ways
"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many people enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow is the road that leads to life, and only a few people ever find it."
True and False Prophets
"Watch out for false prophets. They come to you looking like sheep, but underneath they are hungry wolves. You will recognize them by their fruit. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit. A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot produce good fruit. Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. So then, you will recognize them by their fruit."
True Disciples
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name? Didn't we cast out demons in your name and perform many miracles in your name?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Get away from me, you who live against God’s will!'"
The Two Builders
"Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain fell, the floods rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, but it did not fall because its foundation was built on the rock.
But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain fell, the floods rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash."
The Authority of Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, and not like their legal scholars.

The Gospel Of Matthew Chapter 8


Healing a Leper
When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him. Right then, a man with leprosy came up and knelt before him, saying, "Master, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched him. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Instantly, the man was healed of his leprosy. Then Jesus said to him, "Make sure you don't tell anyone. Instead, go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded in the Law as a testimony to them."
The Faith of the Roman Officer
When Jesus entered Capernaum, a Roman centurion came to him, pleading for help. "Master," he said, "my servant is lying at home paralyzed, suffering terribly."
Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
But the centurion replied, "Master, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those following him, "I tell you the truth, I haven't found faith like this even in Israel! I tell you that many will come from the east and the west and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the Kingdom of Heaven. But the people who were supposed to inherit the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth."
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that very moment.
Healings at Peter’s House
When Jesus went into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He touched her hand and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, people brought many who were demon-possessed to him. He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. This happened to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases."
The Cost of Following Jesus
When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. A religious scholar came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to even lay his head."
Another disciple said to him, "Master, first let me go and bury my father."
But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."
Calming the Storm
Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him. Suddenly, a massive storm blew up on the lake, so that the waves were washing over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. The disciples went and woke him up, shouting, "Master, save us! We’re going to drown!"
He replied, "Why are you so afraid, you of little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it became completely calm.
The men were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!"
The Gadarene Demoniacs
When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. "What do you want with us, Son of God?" they shouted. "Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?"
A large herd of pigs was feeding some distance from them. The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
He said to them, "Go!" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water. Those tending the pigs ran off, went into town, and reported everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.

Healing and Forgiveness
Jesus got into a boat, crossed back over the lake, and came to his own town. Some people brought to him a paralyzed man lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
At this, some of the religious scholars said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, "Why do you entertain such evil thoughts in your hearts? Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go home." Then the man got up and went home. When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe and praised God, who had given such authority to men.
The Calling of Matthew
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.
While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
On hearing this, Jesus said, "Is it the healthy who need a doctor, or the sick? Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
A Question About Fasting
Then John’s disciples came and asked him, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast. No one patches an old garment with a piece of unshrunk cloth, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved."
A Dead Girl and a Suffering Woman
While he was saying this, a Jewish leader came and knelt before him and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live." Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples.
Just then, a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his garment. She said to herself, "If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Take heart, daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the leader’s house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd, he said, "Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep." But they laughed at him. After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. News of this spread through all that region.
Healing the Blind and Mute
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?"
"Yes, Master," they replied.
Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be done to you"; and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, "See that no one knows about this." But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.
While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus. And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons."
The Harvest is Great
Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field."

The Twelve Apostles
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out unclean spirits and to heal every kind of disease and sickness. These are the names of the twelve apostles:
first, Peter, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew;
James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
Philip and Bartholomew;
Thomas and Matthew the tax collector;
James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
Peter the Zealot;
and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Jesus.
The Mission Instructions
Jesus sent these twelve out with these instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Instead, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: 'The Kingdom of Heaven is near.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.
Do not take any gold, silver, or copper with you in your belts; no bag for the journey, no extra shirt, no sandals, and no walking stick, for the worker is worth his keep.
Whatever town or village you enter, look there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave.
As you enter the home, give it your greeting.
If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you.
If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet.
Truly, I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.
Coming Persecutions
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore, be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and you will be flogged in the synagogues. On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. Everyone will hate you because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly, I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters."If the head of the house has been called 'Lord of Demons,' how much more the members of his household!"
Fear God, Not Men
So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs. Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.
Not Peace, But a Sword
Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—a man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.
Rewards
Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the One who sent me. Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward. And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward."

Messengers from John
After Jesus finished giving these instructions to his twelve disciples, he left that place to teach and preach in the surrounding towns of Galilee.
Meanwhile, John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of the Messiah. He sent his disciples to ask him, "Are you the 'One who is to come,' or should we be looking for someone else?"
Jesus answered them, "Go back and report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. Blessed is anyone who does not stumble or take offense because of me."
Jesus’s Tribute to John
As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces. Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'
Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he. From the days of John until now, the Kingdom of Heaven has been subjected to violence, and the violent try to seize it. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. Whoever has ears, let them hear.
This Unresponsive Generation
To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others: 'We played the pipe for you, but you did not dance; we sang a dirge, but you did not cry.' For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is proved right by what it produces."
Woe to the Unrepentant Cities
Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, wearing sackcloth and sitting in ashes in grief. But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you."
Rest for the Weary
At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, because you were pleased to do this Father.”
“My Father has given everything to me. No one truly knows the Son without the Father, and no one truly knows the Father without the Son and those the Son chooses to show him to.”
“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”

Lord of the Sabbath
Around that time, Jesus was walking through some grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is forbidden on the Sabbath."
He answered them, "Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the House of God, and he and his companions ate the Bread of the Presence, which was not legal for him to eat, but only for the priests. Or haven't you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the Temple break the Sabbath and yet are innocent? I tell you that something greater than the Temple is here. If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Healing on the Sabbath
Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, "Is it legal to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is legal to do good on the Sabbath." Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other. But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
The Chosen Servant
Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Many followed him, and he healed all who were ill. He warned them not to tell others who he was. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
“Here is my chosen servant, the one I love and delight in. I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations. He will not argue or shout, and no one will hear him raise his voice in the streets. He will not break a bruised reed, and he will not put out a smoldering wick, until he brings justice to victory. And the nations will place their hope in his name.”
Jesus and Beelzebul
Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. All the people were astonished and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house. Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit. You brood of snakes, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken. For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned."
The Sign of Jonah
Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the Law said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
He answered, "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here. The Queen of the South, the Queen of Sheba , will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.
When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order.Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation."
Jesus’s Mother and Brothers
While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you."
He replied to him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?" Pointing to his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers. For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."

The Parable of the Sower
That same day Jesus left the house and sat by the lake. Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. Then he told them many things in parables, saying: “Listen! A sower went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate them up. Some fell on rocky places, where they did not have much soil. They sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil, where they produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. Whoever has ears, let them hear.”
Why Parables?
The disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do you speak to the people using parables?”
He answered,
“Because you have been given the understanding of the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven, but they have not.
Whoever has understanding will be given more, and they will have plenty.
But whoever does not have understanding will lose even what they think they have.
“This is why I speak to them in parables:
They look, but they do not really see.
They listen, but they do not really hear or understand.
“What Isaiah said about them is coming true:
‘You will keep hearing, but you will never understand.
You will keep seeing, but you will never truly see.
These people have become hard in their hearts.
They hardly listen with their ears,
and they have closed their eyes.
Otherwise, they might see with their eyes,
hear with their ears,
understand in their hearts,
turn back to me,
and I would heal them.’”


But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
The Sower Explained
Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: When anyone hears the message about The Kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path. The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”
The Wheat and the Weeds
Jesus told them another parable: “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’
‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.
The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’
‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”
Mustard Seed and Yeast
He told them another parable: “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.”
He told them still another parable: “The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked through all the dough.”
Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: “I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.”
The Wheat and Weeds Explained
Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”
He answered, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one, and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.
As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.
Hidden Treasure and the Pearl
The Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.
The Net
Once again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
“Have you understood all these things?” Jesus asked.
“Yes,” they replied.
He said to them, “Therefore every teacher of the Law who has become a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like the owner of a house who brings new treasures out of his storeroom as well as old.”
A Prophet Without Honor
When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?” they asked. “Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary, and aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? Aren’t all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?” And they took offense at him.
But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.” And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.

The Death of John the Baptist
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus and said to his attendants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was his brother Philip’s wife, and John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to have her.” Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet.
On Herod’s birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests and pleased Herod so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. Led by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist, here on a platter.” The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her request be granted and had John beheaded in the prison. His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother. John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.
Feeding the Five Thousand
When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns. When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a remote place, and it’s already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”
Jesus replied, “They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”
“We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered.
“Bring them here to me,” he said. And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children.
Walking on the Water
Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.
Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,” they said, and cried out in fear.
But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”
“Lord, if it is you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.”
“Come,” he said.
Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?”
And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”
Miracles at Gennesaret
When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.

Traditions and the Heart
Then some religious leaders and teachers of the Law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked him, “Why do your followers break the rules handed down by our ancestors? They do not wash their hands before they eat bread.”
Jesus answered them, “And why do you break the command of God just to keep your own traditions? For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother.’ He also said, ‘Anyone who speaks evil of their father or mother must be put to death.’ But you teach that a person can say to their parents, ‘The support I should have given you has been set aside as a gift to God.’ Because of this, you say they no longer need to honor their father or mother. In this way, you cancel the word of God for the sake of your own traditions.
“You are faking it! Isaiah the prophet was right when he spoke about you: ‘These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far away from me. Their worship is empty. They teach human rules as if they were my commands.’”
Jesus called the crowd to him. He said, “Listen and try to understand. What goes into a person’s mouth does not make them dirty or ‘unclean’ in the eyes of God. It is what comes out of a person’s mouth that makes them unclean.”
Then the disciples came to him. They asked, “Do you know that the religious leaders were offended by what you said?”
Jesus replied, “Every plant that my Father in heaven did not plant will be pulled up by the roots. Leave them alone. They are blind men trying to lead other blind men. If a blind person leads another blind person, they will both fall into a pit.”
Peter said to him, “Explain this word-picture to us.”
“Do you still not understand?” Jesus asked. “Don’t you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes down into the stomach. Then it passes out of the body. But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. Those are the things that make a person unclean. For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, and being unfaithful in marriage. From the heart comes stealing, lying, and saying hurtful things about God or others. These are what make a person dirty. But eating with unwashed hands does not make anyone unclean.”
A Mother’s Faith
Jesus left that place and went to the area of Tyre and Sidon. A woman from that land came to him. She was not from the house of Israel. She cried out, “Lord, Son of David, please have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly because of a demon.”
But Jesus did not say a word to her. His disciples came and urged him, “Send her away. She keeps crying out and following us.”
Jesus said, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said.
He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”
“Yes, Lord,” she said. “But even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”
Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, you have great faith! I will do what you have asked.” And her daughter was healed at that very moment.
Healing and Feeding the Four Thousand
Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. He went up on a hill and sat down. Large crowds came to him. They brought people who could not walk, people who were blind, people who were crippled, and those who could not speak. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them. The people were amazed. They saw people speaking who couldn't talk before. They saw crippled hands made strong. They saw the blind seeing and the lame walking. They all gave praise to the God of Israel.
Jesus called his disciples to him. He said, “I feel deeply for these people. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry. They might collapse on the way home.”
His disciples answered, “Where could we find enough bread in this lonely place to feed such a large crowd?”
“How many loaves of bread do you have?” Jesus asked.
“Seven,” they said, “and a few small fish.”
Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground. He took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks to God and broke them. He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. Everyone ate until they were full. Afterward, the disciples picked up seven large baskets full of leftover pieces. There were four thousand men who ate, plus many women and children.
After Jesus sent the crowd home, he got into the boat and went to the area of Magadan.

Demanding a Sign
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a miracle from the sky to prove who he was.
Jesus answered them, “When evening comes, you say, ‘The weather will be good because the sky is red.’ In the morning, you say, ‘It will be a stormy day because the sky is red and dark.’ You know how to read the look of the sky. But you cannot read the signs of what is happening right now in the world. An evil and adulterous generation who are untrustworthy and unfaithful look for a special sign. But no sign will be given except the sign of Jonah.” Then Jesus left them and went away.
Be Careful of the Yeast
When the disciples went across the lake, they realized they had forgotten to bring any bread. Jesus said to them, “Watch out. Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.”
They began to talk among themselves. They said, “He is saying this because we didn't bring any bread.”
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said, “You have so little trust! Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not understand? Don’t you remember the five loaves of bread for the five thousand people? Remember how many baskets of leftovers you picked up? And don’t you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? Remember how many large baskets you filled then? Why don't you understand that I wasn't talking to you about bread? I told you to watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
Then they finally understood. He wasn't telling them to watch out for the yeast used in bread. He was telling them to watch out for the teachings of those religious leaders.
Who is Jesus?
Jesus went to the area of Caesarea Philippi. He asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”
They replied, “Some say John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. Still others say Jeremiah or one of the other prophets from long ago.”
“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”
Peter answered, “You are the the Chosen One. You are the Son of the living God.”
Jesus said to him, “You are a blessed man, Peter son of Jonah. No human being taught you this. My Father in heaven showed it to you. And I tell you, you are Peter (the Rock). On this rock I will build my community of people. Even the power of death will not be able to defeat it. I will give you the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven. Whatever you lock on earth will be locked in heaven. Whatever you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven.” Then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone yet that he was the Massiah.
Jesus Speaks of His Death
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what must happen. He told them he must go to Jerusalem. He told them he would suffer many things from the elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of the Law. He told them he must be killed, and that on the third day he would be raised to life.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to correct him. “May God keep that from happening, Lord!” he said. “This must never happen to you!”
Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me. You are not thinking about the things of God. You are only thinking about the things of men.”
Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to follow me, they must say no to what they want for themselves. They must pick up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life for themselves will lose it. But whoever gives up their life for me will find it. What good does it do a person to win the whole world but lose their very soul? Or what can a person give in exchange for their life?
“The Son of Man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his angels. At that time, he will give to each person what they deserve for what they have done. I tell you the truth, there are some standing here right now who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.”

A Glimpse of Glory
Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John up a high mountain by themselves. While they were watching, Jesus’s appearance changed. His face began to shine as bright as the sun. His clothes became white like light.
Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared and were talking with him.
Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here! If you want, I will put up three shelters here—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them. A voice came from the cloud and said, “This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!”
When the disciples heard this, they fell face down on the ground. They were terrified. But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Don't be afraid.” When they looked up, they saw no one there except Jesus.
As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them a command. He said, “Do not tell anyone what you saw until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”
The disciples asked him, “Then why do the teachers of the Law say that Elijah must come first?”
Jesus answered, “Elijah is coming, and he will put everything back in order. But I tell you, Elijah has already come. People did not recognize him. They treated him however they wanted. In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.” Then the disciples understood that he was talking about John the Baptist.
Healing a Boy
When they reached the crowd, a man came to Jesus and knelt before him. “Lord, please have mercy on my son,” he said. “He has seizures and is suffering terribly. He often falls into the fire or into the water. I brought him to your followers, but they could not heal him.”
Jesus said, “You people have no faith and have lost your way. How long must I stay with you? How long must I put up with this? Bring the boy here to me.” Jesus spoke firmly to the demon, and it came out of the boy. He was healed from that very moment.
Later, the disciples talked to Jesus in private. They asked, “Why couldn't we drive it out?”
Jesus answered, “Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth, if your faith is as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”
A Second Warning
While they were together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be handed over to men. They will kill him. But on the third day, he will be raised to life.” This made the disciples very sad.
The Temple Tax
When Jesus and his followers arrived in Capernaum, the men who collect the Temple tax came to Peter. They asked, “Does your teacher pay the tax?”
“Yes, he does,” Peter answered.
When Peter went into the house, Jesus spoke first. “What do you think, Peter?” he asked. “Who do the kings of the earth collect taxes from? Do they collect from their own children or from others?”
Peter answered, “From others.”
“Then the children are free from the tax,” Jesus said. “But we do not want to upset them. So go to the lake and throw out a fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth, and you will find a silver coin. Take that coin and give it to them for my tax and yours.”

Who is the Greatest?
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?”
Jesus called a little child to him and had the child stand among them. He said, “I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never even enter the Kingdom of Heaven. The person who makes themselves humble like this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven. And anyone who welcomes a little child like this in my name is welcoming me.
“But if anyone causes one of these little ones who trusts in me to trip and fall into a trap, it would be better for that person to have a huge heavy stone tied around their neck and be drowned in the deep sea.
“The world is full of things that cause people to trip and fall. Those things will happen, but it will be terrible for the person who causes them. If your hand or your foot causes you to trip, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life without a hand or a foot than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the fire that never goes out. And if your eye causes you to trip, pull it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of Gehenna.
The Lost Sheep
“Be careful. Do not look down on these little ones. I tell you that their angels in heaven are always looking at the face of my Father in heaven.
“Think about this: If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away, what will he do? Won’t he leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go look for the one that is lost? And I tell you the truth, if he finds it, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander away. In the same way, your Father in heaven does not want even one of these little ones to be lost.
When Someone Hurts You
“If your brother or sister does something wrong to you, go and talk to them alone. Tell them what they did. If they listen to you, you have won them back. But if they will not listen, take one or two other people with you. Then every word may be proven by two or three witnesses. If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the community of believers. And if they refuse to listen even to the community, then treat them like the Gentiles or like a tax collector.
“I tell you the truth, whatever you lock on earth will be locked in heaven. Whatever you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven.
“Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, my Father in heaven will do it for you. For where two or three people come together because of me, I am there with them.”
A Story About Forgiveness
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother or sister when they keep hurting me? Up to seven times?”
Jesus answered, “I tell you, not just seven times, but seventy-seven times.
“This is why the Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who wanted to settle his accounts with his servants. As he began, a man was brought to him who owed him millions of dollars. Since the man could not pay, the master ordered that he be sold as a slave. He ordered the man’s wife, his children, and everything he owned to be sold to pay the debt.
“The servant fell on his knees before the king. ‘Please be patient with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’ The master felt deep pity for him. He let the servant go and told him he didn't have to pay the debt back at all.
“But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him just a few dollars. He grabbed him and started to choke him. ‘Pay me what you owe me!’ he demanded.
“His fellow servant fell on his knees and begged him, ‘Please be patient with me, and I will pay you back.’
“But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. When the other servants saw what had happened, they were very upset. They went and told their master everything.
“Then the master called the servant in. ‘You wicked servant,’ he said. ‘I cancelled that whole debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had mercy on you?’ The master was very angry. He handed the servant over to be punished until he should pay back all he owed.
“This is how my Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”

Marriage and Divorce
When Jesus finished saying these things, he left Galilee. He went into the area of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River. Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?”
Jesus answered, “Haven’t you read the scriptures? In the beginning, the Creator made them male and female. He said, ‘For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife. The two will become one body.’ So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore, no human should pull apart what God has joined together.”
They asked him, “Then why did Moses command that a man could give his wife a letter of divorce and send her away?”
Jesus replied, “Moses allowed you to divorce your wives only because your hearts were hard. But it was not that way in the beginning. I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is committng adultery, unless his wife has already committed adultery first.”
His disciples said to him, “If that is how it is between a husband and a wife, it is better never to get married.”
Jesus said, “Not everyone can accept this teaching. Only those to whom it has been given can understand it. Some eunuchs are born unable to marry. Some are made that way by others. And some choose not to marry so they can focus entirely on the Kingdom of Heaven. Let anyone who can accept this, accept it.”
Jesus Blesses the Children
Then people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop and stay back.
Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me. Don’t stop them. The Kingdom of Heaven belongs to people who are like these children.” He placed his hands on them and blessed them, then he left that place.
The Rich Young Man
A man came up to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to have life that lasts forever?”
“Why do you ask me about what is good?” Jesus asked. “There is only One who is truly good. If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”
“Which ones?” the man asked.
Jesus answered, “Do not murder. Do not be unfaithful in marriage. Do not steal. Do not lie about others. Honor your father and mother. And love your neighbor as much as you love yourself.”
The young man said, “I have kept all of these. What am I still missing?”
Jesus told him, “If you want to be complete, go and sell what you own. Give the money to the poor. If you do, you will have riches in heaven. Then come and follow me.”
When the young man heard this, he went away very sad. He was very rich and owned many things.
Wealth and the Kingdom
Jesus said to his disciples, “I tell you the truth, it is very hard for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God.”
When the disciples heard this, they were very surprised. They asked, “Then who can ever be saved?”
Jesus looked at them and said, “With people, this is impossible. But with God, all things are possible.”
Peter said to him, “Look, we have left everything to follow you. What will there be for us?”
Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, when the world is made new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. At that time, you who followed me will also sit on twelve thrones. You will judge the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children, or farms because of me will receive a hundred times more. They will also receive everlasting life.
“But many who are first now will be last in the Kingdom of Heaven, and many who are last now will be first in the Kingdom of Heaven.”

The Workers in the Vineyard
Jesus said, “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. He agreed to pay them the normal daily wage and sent them into his fields.
“At nine o’clock in the morning, he went back to the marketplace. He saw others standing around with nothing to do. He told them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard. I will pay you whatever is fair.’ So they went.
“He did the same thing again at noon and at three o’clock in the afternoon. Finally, at five o’clock, he went out and found others still standing there. He asked them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day doing nothing?’
“‘Because no one hired us,’ they answered.
“He said to them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard.’
“When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages. Start with the ones who were hired last and end with the ones who were hired first.’
“The workers who were hired at five o’clock came, and each received a full day’s pay. When the workers who were hired first came, they expected to get more. But each of them also received the same daily wage. When they received it, they began to complain to the landowner. They said, ‘These men who were hired last only worked one hour. You have made them equal to us, and we did all the hard work in the heat of the day!’
“The landowner answered one of them, ‘Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Didn't you agree to work for the normal daily wage? Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you jealous because I am kind?’
“So the last will be first, and the first will be last.”
Jesus Speaks of His Death Again
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside. On the way, he said to them, “Listen, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the leading priests and the teachers of the Law. They will say he must die. They will hand him over to the foreigners to be mocked, whipped, and nailed to a cross. But on the third day, he will be raised to life.”
A Mother’s Request
Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus with her sons. She knelt down and asked him for a favor.
“What is it you want?” Jesus asked.
She said, “Promise me that in your Kingdom, these two sons of mine may sit next to you—one on your right and one on your left.”
“You don’t know what you are asking,” Jesus said to them. “Can you drink the cup of suffering that I am about to drink?”
“We can,” they answered.
Jesus said to them, “You will indeed drink from my cup. But to sit at my right or left is not mine to give. Those places belong to those for whom my Father has prepared them.”
When the other ten disciples heard about this, they were angry with the two brothers. Jesus called them all together. He said, “You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over their people. Their high officials use their power to push people around. But it should not be that way with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant. And whoever wants to be first must be your slave. You should be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served. He came to serve others and to give his life to buy freedom for many people.”
Two Blind Men Healed
As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him. Two blind men were sitting by the side of the road. When they heard that Jesus was walking by, they shouted, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
The crowd told them to be quiet, but they shouted even louder, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
Jesus stopped and called to them. “What do you want me to do for you?” he asked.
“Lord,” they answered, “we want to be able to see.”
Jesus felt deep pity for them and touched their eyes. Immediately they could see, and they followed him.

The Gospel Of Matthew Chapter 21


The Triumphal Entry As they came near Jerusalem and reached Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples ahead. He told them, “Go into the village over there. Right away you will find a donkey tied up, with her colt next to her. Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, just say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them right away.”
This happened to make the words of the prophet come true: “Tell the people of Israel, ‘Look, your King is coming to you. He is humble, riding on a donkey—yes, on a colt, the offspring of a beast of burden.’”
The disciples went and did exactly what Jesus told them to do. They brought the donkey and the colt and laid their robes on them, and Jesus sat on the robes. A very large crowd spread their robes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the path. The crowds walking in front of him and those following behind shouted, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!”
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in an uproar. People asked, “Who is this?”
The crowds answered, “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee.”
Jesus at the Temple 
Jesus went into the Temple and threw out all the people who were buying and selling there. He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves. He told them, “The Scriptures say, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a hideout for thieves!”
Blind and crippled people came to him at the Temple, and he healed them. But when the leading priests and the teachers of the Law saw the wonderful things he did, and heard the children shouting in the Temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they were moved to anger. They asked him, “Do you hear what these children are saying?”
“Yes,” Jesus answered. “Haven’t you ever read the Scriptures? They say, ‘You have taught children and babies to give perfect praise.’”
Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.
The Fig Tree Withers 
Early the next morning, as Jesus was returning to the city, he was hungry. He saw a fig tree by the side of the road and went over to it, but there was nothing on it except leaves. He said to the tree, “May you never bear fruit again!” Right away, the fig tree withered up.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. They asked, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?”
Jesus answered, “I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, you can do more than what was done to this fig tree. You can even say to this mountain, ‘May you be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and it will happen. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”
The Authority of Jesus Challenged 
Jesus went into the Temple and began teaching. The leading priests and the elders of the people came to him. They asked, “By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this right?”
Jesus answered, “I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, then I will tell you by what authority I do these things. Where did John’s authority to baptize come from? Was it from heaven or from humans?”
They talked it over among themselves. They said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ But if we say, ‘From humans,’ we are afraid of the crowd, because everyone thinks John was a prophet.” So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”
Jesus said to them, “Then I won’t tell you by what authority I do these things either.”
The Story of the Two Sons 
“What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’ The son answered, ‘I won’t go,’ but later he changed his mind and went. Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. That son answered, ‘I will go, sir,’ but he didn’t go. Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?”
“The first one,” they answered.
Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, corrupt tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the Kingdom of God before you. For John came to show you the right way to live, and you didn’t believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him. Even after you saw this, you didn’t change your minds and believe him.”
The Story of the Evil Farmers 
“Listen to another story. A landowner planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for pressing the grape juice, and built a lookout tower. Then he leased the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another country. When the time came to harvest the fruit, he sent his servants to the farmers to collect his share.
“But the farmers grabbed his servants. They beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. So the owner sent more servants than the first time, and the farmers treated them the same way. Finally, he sent his own son to them. He thought, ‘They will surely respect my son.’
“But when the farmers saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the heir who will inherit the estate. Come on, let’s kill him and take his inheritance for ourselves!’ So they grabbed him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
“Now, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?”
The religious leaders answered, “He will bring those wicked men to a wretched end and lease the vineyard to other farmers who will give him his share of the crop at the right time.”
Jesus said to them, “Haven’t you ever read in the Scriptures: ‘The stone that the builders rejected as worthless has now become the cornerstone. This is the Lord’s doing, and it is wonderful to see’?”
“Therefore, I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush anyone it falls on.”
When the leading priests and the Pharisees heard these stories, they realized he was talking about them. They wanted to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowds, because the people held that he was a prophet.

The Story of the Wedding Feast
Jesus spoke to them in stories again. He said, “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who prepared a great wedding feast for his son. He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to come to the wedding, but they refused to come.
“He sent other servants and told them, ‘Tell those who are invited that I have prepared the meal. My prize cattle and fattened calves have been butchered. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding!’
“But the invited guests didn't care. One went to his farm, and another went to his business. The rest of them grabbed the king's servants, treated them cruelly, and killed them. The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy those murderers and burn their city.
“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. So go out to the main roads and invite anyone you find to the wedding.’ The servants went out into the streets and gathered everyone they could find—both good people and bad people. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
“But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man who was not wearing wedding clothes. He asked him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ The man had nothing to say.
“Then the king told his helpers, ‘Tie him hand and foot and throw him outside into the darkness. In that place, people will cry and grind their teeth in pain.’ For many are called, but few are chosen.”
Taxes for Caesar
Then the Pharisees went out and made a plan to trap Jesus in his own words. They sent their followers to him along with some supporters of Herod. They said, “Teacher, we know that you are an honest man. You teach the way of God truthfully. You aren't swayed by what people think, because you don't care about a person’s status. So tell us what you think: Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”
Jesus knew they were being evil. He said, “You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me? Show me the coin used for the tax.” They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, “Whose picture is this? And whose name is written on it?”
“Caesar’s,” they answered.
Then he said to them, “Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God.” When they heard this, they were amazed. They left him alone and went away.
A Question About Rising from Death
That same day, some Sadducees came to Jesus. (They are the ones who say that people do not rise from the dead.) They asked him a question.
“Teacher,” they said, “Moses said that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow to have children for his brother. Now, there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. The same thing happened to the second brother, and the third, all the way to the seventh. Finally, the woman died too. So, when people rise from the dead, whose wife will she be? All seven were married to her.”
Jesus answered, “You are mistaken because you don't know the Scriptures or the power of God. When people rise from the dead, they will not marry or be given in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
“And about people rising from the dead—haven't you read what God said to you? He said, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ He is not the God of the dead, but of the living!” When the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching.
The Most Important Command
When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. One of them, an expert in the Law, tested him with a question. “Teacher, which is the most important command in the Law?”
Jesus said to him, “‘You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest command. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as much as you love yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commands.”
Whose Son is the Messiah?
While the Pharisees were gathered there, Jesus asked them a question. “What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?”
“The son of David,” they answered.
Jesus said to them, “Then why did David, speaking by the Spirit, call him ‘Lord’? David said: ‘The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right side until I put your enemies under your feet.’ If David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be David’s son?”
No one could say a single word in answer. And from that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.

Warnings Against Hypocrisy
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples. He said, “The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees sit in the seat of Moses. So you should obey them and do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, because they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, uncomfortable loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they aren't willing to lift a finger to help carry them.
“Everything they do is just for show. They wear extra-wide prayer boxes on their foreheads and arms, and they make the tassels on their prayer shawls extra long. They love the places of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues. They love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi.’
“But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have only one Teacher, and you are all brothers and sisters. And do not call anyone on earth ‘Father,’ for you have only one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor should you be called ‘Instructors,’ for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.
Seven Warnings
“How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You shut the door of the Kingdom of Heaven in people’s faces. You won't go in yourselves, and you won’t let anyone else enter either”.
“How terrible for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you succeed, you make them twice as much a child of Gehenna as you are.
“How terrible it will be for you, blind guides! You say that swearing by the Temple means nothing, but swearing by the gold in the Temple makes an oath binding. You blind fools! Which is greater—the gold, or the Temple that makes the gold holy? You say swearing by the altar means nothing, but swearing by the gift on it is binding. Which is greater—the gift, or the altar that makes the gift holy? Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. And anyone who swears by the Temple swears by it and by the One who lives in it. And anyone who swears by heaven swears by God’s throne and by the One who sits on it.”
“How terrible for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill, and cumin. But you have ignored the more important matters of the Law—justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a whole camel!
“How terrible for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but on the inside they are full of greed and selfishness. Blind Pharisees! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside will also be clean.
“How terrible for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and all unclean things. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous, but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
“How terrible for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous. And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have helped them kill the prophets.’ So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Go ahead, then, and finish what your ancestors started!
“You snakes! You bunch of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Gehenna? Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers. Some of them you will kill and nail to crosses; others you will whip in your synagogues and chase from town to town. Because of this, you will be held responsible for all the innocent blood spilled on the earth—from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar. I tell you the truth, all this will fall on this generation.
Jesus’s Sorrow for Jerusalem
“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing. Look, your house is left to you desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!’”

Signs of the End
Jesus left the Temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him. They pointed out the impressive Temple buildings. But Jesus said to them, “Do you see all these things? I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on top of another. Every single one will be thrown down.”
Later, while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
Jesus answered, “Watch out that no one deceives you. Many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and they will fool many people. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, see that you aren't alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are just the beginning of birth pains.
“Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and killed. You will be hated by all nations because of me. At that time, many will turn away from the faith. They will betray and hate each other. Many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because lawlessness will increase, the love of most will grow cold. But the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. And this Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
The Great Trouble
“So when you see the ‘abomination of desolation’ standing in the Set-Apart place—the thing the prophet Daniel spoke about, let the reader understand, then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains. A person on the roof of a house must not go down to take anything out of the house. A person in the field must not go back to get a coat. How terrible it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.
“For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again. If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened.
“If anyone says to you at that time, ‘Look, here is the Messiah,’ or ‘There he is,’ do not believe it. False messiahs and false prophets will appear. They will perform great signs and wonders to try to deceive people—if possible, even those God has chosen. I am warning you about this ahead of time. So if someone tells you, ‘He is out in the wilderness,’ do not go. Or if they say, ‘He is hiding in a secret room,’ do not believe it. When the Son of Man comes, it will not be hidden or local. It will be as obvious as lightning flashing across the entire sky. Just as vultures gather where a dead body lies, the signs of his coming will be impossible to miss.”


The Coming of the Son of Man
“Immediately after the distress of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
“Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven. All the tribes of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his chosen from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
The Lesson of the Fig Tree
“Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. In the same way, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
Always Be Ready
“But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, right up to the day Noah entered the ark. They knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.
“Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.
“Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time? It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, ‘My master is taking a long time,’ and he begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.”

The Story of the Ten Bridesmaids
“At that time, the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but didn't take any extra oil with them. But the wise ones took jars of oil along with their lamps.
“When the groom was late, they all got drowsy and fell asleep. At midnight, a shout rang out: ‘Look! The groom is here! Come out to meet him!’
“Then all the bridesmaids woke up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the wise ones, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’
“‘No,’ they replied, ‘there might not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’
“But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the groom arrived. The bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. Later the other bridesmaids arrived. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they said, ‘open the door for us!’
“But he replied, ‘I tell you the truth, I don’t know you.’
“Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.
The Story of the Three Servants
“Again, the Kingdom is like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and put them in charge of his property. To one he gave five bags of silver, to another two bags, and to another one bag—each according to what he could handle. Then he went on his journey.
“The man who had received five bags of silver went at once and put his money to work and gained five more bags. In the same way, the one with two bags of silver gained two more. But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money.
“After a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received five bags of silver brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of silver. See, I have gained five more.’
“His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’
“The man with two bags of silver also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two bags of silver; see, I have gained two more.’
“His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’
“Then the man who had received one bag of silver came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your silver in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’
“His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.
“‘So take the bag of silver from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. For everyone who has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. And throw that useless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.’
The Sheep and the Goats
“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
“Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the Kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’
“Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’
“The King will reply, ‘I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’
“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’
“They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’
“He will reply, ‘I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’
“Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”

The Plot Against Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he told his disciples, “You know that the Passover is two days away. That is when the Son of Man will be handed over to be nailed to a cross.”
At that same time, the head priests and the elders of the people gathered at the palace of the High Priest, whose name was Caiaphas. They made a plan to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him. But they said, “We shouldn't do it during the festival, or the people might riot.”
A Woman Honors Jesus
While Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon (who had been a leper), a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She poured it on his head while he was eating.
When the disciples saw this, they were annoyed. “Why this waste?” they asked. “This perfume could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor.”
Jesus knew what they were saying, so he said, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me. You will always have the poor with you, but you won't always have me. When she poured this perfume on my body, she was preparing me for burial. I tell you the truth, wherever this Good News is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”
Judas Betrays Jesus
Then one of the twelve disciples—the one named Judas Iscariot—went to the head priests and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?” They counted out thirty silver coins for him. From then on, Judas watched for a good chance to betray Jesus.
The Passover Meal
On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?”
He replied, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says: My time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.’” The disciples did as Jesus told them and prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve. While they were eating, he said, “I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.”
They were very sad and started asking him one by one, “Lord, is it me?”
He answered, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me is the one who will betray me. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him, but how terrible it will be for the man who betrays the Son of Man! It would have been better for that man if he had never been born.”
Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, “Rabbi, is it me?”
Jesus answered, “You have said it yourself.”
The New Covenant
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after giving thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take this and eat it; this is my body.”
Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “All of you drink from it. This is my blood, the blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink this fruit of the vine again until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s Kingdom.”
After they sang a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial
Then Jesus told them, “This very night, all of you will fall away because of me. For it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”
Peter replied, “Even if everyone else falls away because of you, I never will.”
“I tell you the truth,” Jesus answered, “this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.”
But Peter insisted, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you!” And all the other disciples said the same thing.
Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be filled with sorrow and distress. He said to them, “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”
Going a little farther, he fell on his face and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.”
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour?” he asked Peter. “Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
He went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.”
When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. So he left them and went away once more and prayed a third time, saying the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is being handed over to sinners. Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”
The Arrest
While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the head priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.” Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him.
Jesus replied, “Friend, do what you came for.”
Then the men stepped forward, grabbed Jesus, and arrested him. With that, one of Jesus’s companions reached for his sword, drew it out, and struck the servant of the High Priest, cutting off his ear.
“Put your sword back in its place,” Jesus said to him, “for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?”
In that hour Jesus said to the crowd, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the Temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me. But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.
Before the Council
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the High Priest, where the teachers of the Law and the elders had gathered. But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the High Priest. He went in and sat down with the guards to see how it would all end.
The head priests and the whole council were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward.
Finally, two came forward and declared, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”
Then the High Priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” But Jesus remained silent.
The High Priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”
“You have said it yourself,” Jesus replied. “But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
Then the High Priest tore his clothes and said, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?”
“He is worthy of death,” they answered.
Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him and said, “Prophesy to us, Messiah! Who hit you?”
Peter Disowns Jesus
Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. “You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” she said.
But he denied it before them all. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.
Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
He denied it again, with an oath: “I don’t know the man!”
After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, “Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away.”
Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I don’t know the man!”
Immediately a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.

Jesus Handed to Pilate
Early the next morning, all the head priests and the elders of the people met to finalize their plan to have Jesus put to death. They tied him up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the Roman governor.
The Death of Judas
When Judas, the one who betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he was filled with regret. He took the thirty silver coins back to the head priests and the elders. “I have sinned,” he said, “for I have betrayed innocent blood.”
“What is that to us?” they replied. “That’s your problem.”
Judas threw the silver coins into the Temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
The head priests picked up the coins and said, “It is against the Law to put this into the Temple treasury, because it is blood money.” So they decided to use the money to buy the Potter’s Field as a burial place for foreigners. That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. This fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet: “They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, and they used them to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded.”
Jesus Before Pilate
Meanwhile, Jesus stood before the governor, and Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
“You have said so,” Jesus replied.
But when he was accused by the head priests and the elders, he gave no answer. Then Pilate asked him, “Don’t you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?” But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge—to the governor’s great amazement.
Now it was the governor’s custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Barabbas. So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Messiah?” For Pilate knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judge’s seat, his wife sent him this message: “Don’t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.”
But the head priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.
“Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor.
“Barabbas!” they answered.
“What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Messiah?” Pilate asked.
They all answered, “Crucify him!”
“Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.
But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!”
All the people answered, “Let his blood be on us and on our children!”
Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.
The Soldiers Mock Jesus
Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. “Hail, king of the Jews!” they said. They spit on him, and took a staff and struck him on the head again and again. After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.
The Crucifixion
As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. They came to a place called Golgotha (which means “The Place of the Skull”). There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. Above his head, they placed a placard stating the charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, “You who are going to destroy the Temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!” In the same way the head priests, the teachers of the Law and the elders mocked him. “He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself! He’s the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’” In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
The Death of Jesus
From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land. About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” (which means “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”).
When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He’s calling Elijah.”
Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. The rest said, “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him.”
And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
At that moment the curtain of the Temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, rocks split and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs after Jesus’s resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, “Surely he was the Son of God!”
Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.
The Burial of Jesus
As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’s body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
The Guard at the Tomb
The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the head priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. “Sir,” they said, “we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.”
“Take a guard,” Pilate answered. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.” So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.

The Gospel Of Matthew Chapter 28


The Resurrection
After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
Suddenly, there was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples: ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.”
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them. “Greetings,” he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.”
The Guards’ Report
While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the head priests everything that had happened. When the head priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, telling them, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.’ If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.” So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.
The Great Commission
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, immersing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”
