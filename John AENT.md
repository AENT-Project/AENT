The Gospel Of John
A Friendly, Plain American English Translation 
(AENT) Accessible English New Testament
This version is written for everyone. We use familiar names like "Law" and "God" rather than the original Aramaic or Hebrew names (like Y'shua or God) because our goal is to make the Bible easy to read and understand. This translation focuses on making the meaning clear so you can understand what was actually being said.
A quick tip for the reader: Whenever you see "THE LORD" in all capital letters, it refers to the personal, sacred name of God. When you see "Lord" in normal letters, it is usually a title of respect, similar to calling someone "Sir" or "Master."
John Chapter 1
The Word Became Flesh
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. This one was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him not even one thing came into being that has come into being. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
There was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that through him everyone might believe. He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light. The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not recognize him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, to those who believe in his name, he gave the right to become children of God—children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.
And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the only-begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. John testified about him and cried out, saying, "This was the one I meant when I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'" From his fullness we have all received grace upon grace. For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus the Messiah. No one has ever seen God; the only-begotten Son, who is at the Father's side, has made him known.
John the Baptist Denies Being the Messiah
This was John's testimony when the Judean leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Messiah."
They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."
Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?" John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way for THE LORD.'"
Now the Pharisees who had been sent questioned him, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?" "I baptize with water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know. He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie." This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
John Testifies About Jesus
The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel."
Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. And I myself would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God."
John's Disciples Follow Jesus
The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. When he saw Jesus walking by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!" When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?" They said, "Teacher, where are you staying?" "Come," he replied, "and you will see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and they spent that day with him. It was about four in the afternoon.
Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (that is, the Messiah). And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Peter."
Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael
The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me." Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." "Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come and see," said Philip.
When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit." "How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you." Then Nathanael declared, "Teacher, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel." Jesus said, "You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that." He then added, "Amen, amen, I tell you, you will see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."

John Chapter 2
The Wedding at Cana
On the third day, a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. When the wine ran out, Jesus's mother said to him, "They have no wine."
Jesus replied to her, "What does that have to do with me and you, woman? My hour has not yet come."
His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."
Six stone water jars were standing there, used for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water." So they filled them to the brim. Then he told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast."
They did so, and the master of the feast tasted the water that had become wine. He did not know where it came from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then the master of the feast called the bridegroom aside and said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then the cheaper wine. But you have kept the good wine until now!"
Jesus performed this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him. After this, he went down to Capernaum with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.
Jesus Clears the Temple
The Passover of the Jews was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the Temple courts, he found people selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and the money changers sitting at their tables. Making a whip out of cords, he drove them all out of the Temple, including the sheep and the oxen. He scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. To those selling the doves he said, "Get these things out of here! Stop making my Father's house a marketplace!"
His disciples remembered that it is written: "Passion for your house will consume me."
The Judean leaders then challenged him, "What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do these things?"
Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
The Judeans replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this Temple, and you are going to raise it up in three days?" But he was speaking about the temple of his body. Therefore, when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.
Jesus Knows All People
Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people believed in his name because they saw the signs he was performing. But Jesus did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people. He did not need anyone to testify about man, for he himself knew what was in a person's heart.

John Chapter 3
Jesus Teaches Nicodemus
There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. He came to Jesus at night and said, "Teacher, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him."
Jesus replied, "Amen, amen, I tell you, no one can see the Kingdom of God unless they are born from above."
"How can someone be born when they are old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother's womb to be born!"
Jesus answered, "Amen, amen, I tell you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born from above.' The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."
"How can this be?" Nicodemus asked.
"You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus, "and do you not understand these things? Amen, amen, I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man. Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him."
For God So Loved the World
For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's only-begotten Son.
This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in God.
John the Baptist Testifies Again About Jesus
After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them and baptized people. Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized. (This was before John was put in prison.)
An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Judean over the matter of ceremonial washing. They came to John and said to him, "Teacher, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan—the one you testified about—look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him."
To this John replied, "A person can receive only what is given them from heaven. You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.' The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. He must become greater; I must become less."
The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on them.

John Chapter 4
Jesus Talks With a Samaritan Woman
When Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John—although it was not Jesus himself who baptized, but his disciples—he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.
Now he had to go through Samaria. So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon.
When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, "Please give me a drink." (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)
The Samaritan woman said to him, "You are a Judean and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?" (For Judeans do not associate with Samaritans.)
Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."
"Sir," the woman said, "you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?"
Jesus answered, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life."
The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water."
He told her, "Go, call your husband and come back."
"I have no husband," she replied.
Jesus said to her, "You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true."
"Sir," the woman said, "I can see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Judeans claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."
"Woman," Jesus replied, "believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Judeans. Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."
The woman said, "I know that Messiah (called Christ) is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."
Then Jesus declared, "I, the one speaking to you—I am he."
The Disciples Rejoin Jesus
Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"
Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, "Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?" They came out of the town and made their way toward him.
Meanwhile his disciples urged him, "Teacher, eat something."
But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about."
Then his disciples said to each other, "Could someone have brought him food?"
"My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. Don't you have a saying, 'It's still four months until harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true. I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor."
Many Samaritans Believe
Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did." So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. And because of his words many more became believers.
They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world."
Jesus Heals an Official's Son
After the two days he left for Galilee. (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there.
Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.
"Unless you people see signs and wonders," Jesus told him, "you will never believe."
The royal official said, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
"Go," Jesus replied, "your son will live."
The man took Jesus at his word and departed. While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, "Yesterday, at one in the afternoon, the fever left him."
Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." So he and his whole household believed. This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.


John Chapter 5
The Healing at the Pool
After this, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool called Bethesda, surrounded by five covered colonnades. In these lay a great number of disabled people—the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed. One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?"
"Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk." At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked.
The day on which this took place was a Sabbath. So the Judean leaders said to the man who had been healed, "It is Sabbath; the Law does not allow you to carry your mat."
But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'"
They asked him, "Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?" The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.
Later Jesus found him at the Temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you." The man went away and told the Judean leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.
The Authority of the Son
So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Judean leaders began to persecute him. In his defense Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working." For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
Jesus gave them this answer: "Amen, amen, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed. For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.
Life Through the Son
Amen, amen, I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life. Amen, amen, I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.
Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out—those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned. By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.
Testimonies About Jesus
If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true. You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it so that you may be saved. John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.
I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to finish—the very works that I am doing—testify that the Father has sent me. And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent. You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life.
I do not accept glory from human beings, but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts. I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him. How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?
But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?"

John Chapter 6
Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand
After this, Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (also known as the Sea of Tiberias). A large crowd followed him because they saw the signs he was performing by healing the sick. Jesus went up on a hillside and sat down there with his disciples. Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
When Jesus looked up and saw the large crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, "Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?" He asked this only to test him, for he already knew what he was going to do.
Philip answered him, "It would take more than half a year's wages to buy enough bread for each person to have even a little bit!"
Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up, "There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?"
Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." There was plenty of grass in that place, and they sat down (about five thousand men were there). Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.
When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, "Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted." So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.
After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world." Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.
Jesus Walks on the Water
When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified.
But he said to them, "It is I; don't be afraid." Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.
Jesus the Bread of Life
The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.
When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, "Teacher, when did you get here?"
Jesus answered, "Amen, amen, I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval."
Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"
Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."
So they asked him, "What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"
Jesus said to them, "Amen, amen, I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."
"Sir," they said, "always give us this bread."
Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day."
Many Disciples Desert Jesus
At this the Judean leaders began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven." They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?"
"Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered. "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day. It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me. No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. Amen, amen, I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness, yet they died. But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."
Then the Judeans began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
Jesus said to them, "Amen, amen, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever." He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
On hearing it, many of his disciples said, "This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?"
Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, "Does this offend you? Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life. Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them."
From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.
"You do not want to leave too, do you?" Jesus asked the Twelve.
Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God."
Then Jesus replied, "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!" (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)

John Chapter 7
Jesus Goes to the Festival of Tabernacles
After this, Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. He did not want to go about in Judea because the Judean leaders there were looking for a way to kill him. But when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near, his brothers said to him, "Leave Galilee and go to Judea, so that your disciples there may see the works you do. No one who wants to be a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world." For even his own brothers did not believe in him.
Therefore Jesus told them, "My time is not yet here; for you any time will do. The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that its works are evil. You go to the festival. I am not going up to this festival, because my time has not yet fully come." After he said this, he stayed in Galilee.
However, after his brothers had left for the festival, he went also, not publicly, but in secret. Now at the festival the Judean leaders were watching for him and asking, "Where is he?" Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others replied, "No, he deceives the people." But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the leaders.
Jesus Teaches at the Festival
Not until halfway through the festival did Jesus go up to the Temple courts and begin to teach. The Judeans there were amazed and asked, "How did this man get such learning without having been taught?"
Jesus answered, "My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me. Anyone who chooses to do God's will will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own. Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him. Has not Moses given you the Law? Yet not one of you keeps the Law. Why are you trying to kill me?"
"You are demon-possessed," the crowd answered. "Who is trying to kill you?"
Jesus said to them, "I did one miracle, and you are all amazed. Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath. Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the Law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing a man's whole body on the Sabbath? Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly."
Division Over Who Jesus Is
At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, "Isn't this the man they are trying to kill? Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Messiah? But we know where this man is from; when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from."
Then Jesus, still teaching in the Temple courts, cried out, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own authority, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him, but I know him because I am from him and he sent me."
At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. Still, many in the crowd believed in him. They said, "When the Messiah comes, will he perform more signs than this man?"
The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent Temple guards to arrest him. Jesus said, "I am with you for only a short time, and then I am going to the one who sent me. You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come."
The Judeans said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? What did he mean when he said, 'You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and 'Where I am, you cannot come'?"
On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them." By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.
On hearing his words, some of the people said, "Surely this man is the Prophet." Others said, "He is the Messiah." Still others asked, "How can the Messiah come from Galilee? Does not Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David's descendants and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?" Thus the people were divided because of Jesus. Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.
Unbelief of the Jewish Leaders
Finally the Temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees, who asked them, "Why didn't you bring him in?"
"No one ever spoke the way this man does," the guards replied.
"You mean he has deceived you also?" the Pharisees retorted. "Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him? No! But this mob that knows nothing of the Law—there is a curse on them."
Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked, "Does our Law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing?"
They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee."
Then they all went to their own homes.

John Chapter 8
The Woman Caught in Adultery
Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. Early the next morning, he appeared again in the Temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.
The Law scholars and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now, what do you say?" They were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him.
But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her." Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"
"No one, sir," she said.
"Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go now and leave your life of sin."
The Light of the World
When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."
The Pharisees challenged him, "Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid."
Jesus answered, "Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going. You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one. But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me. In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true. I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me."
Then they asked him, "Where is your father?"
"You do not know me or my Father," Jesus replied. "If you knew me, you would know my Father also." He spoke these words while teaching in the Temple courts near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come.
Dispute Over Who Jesus Is
Once more Jesus said to them, "I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come."
This made the Judean leaders ask, "Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?"
But he continued, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he, you will indeed die in your sins."
"Who are you?" they asked.
"Just what I have been telling you from the beginning," Jesus replied. "I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from him I tell the world."
They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me. The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him." Even as he spoke, many believed in him.
The Children of Abraham
To the Judeans who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
They answered him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?"
Jesus replied, "Amen, amen, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. I know that you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me, because my word has no place in you. I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father."
"Abraham is our father," they answered.
"If you were Abraham's children," said Jesus, "then you would do what Abraham did. As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things. You are doing the works of your own father."
"We are not illegitimate children," they protested. "The only Father we have is God himself."
The Children of the Devil
Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; he sent me. Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me! Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me? Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God."
Jesus's Claims About Himself
The Judeans answered him, "Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?"
"I am not possessed by a demon," said Jesus, "but I honor my Father and you dishonor me. I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge. Amen, amen, I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death."
At this they exclaimed, "Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death. Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?"
Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me. Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I obey his word. Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."
"You are not yet fifty years old," they said to him, "and you have seen Abraham?"
"Amen, amen, I tell you," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"
At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the Temple grounds.

John Chapter 9
Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been blind from birth. His disciples asked him, "Teacher, who sinned—this man or his parents—that he was born blind?"
"Neither this man nor his parents sinned," Jesus answered, "but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him. We must do the works of the one who sent me while it is still day. Night is coming, when no one can work. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes. "Go," he told him, "wash in the Pool of Siloam." So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.
His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, "Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?" Some claimed that he was. Others said, "No, he only looks like him."
But the man himself insisted, "I am the man."
"How then were your eyes opened?" they asked.
He replied, "The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see."
"Where is this man?" they asked him.
"I don't know," he said.
The Pharisees Investigate the Healing
They brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees. Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath. Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. "He put mud on my eyes," the man replied, "and I washed, and now I see."
Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath."
But others asked, "How can a sinner perform such signs?" So they were divided.
Then they turned again to the blind man, "What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened."
The man replied, "He is a prophet."
The Judean leaders still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents. "Is this your son?" they asked. "Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?"
"We know he is our son," the parents answered, "and we know he was born blind. But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself." His parents said this because they were afraid of the Judean leaders, who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. That was why his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."
A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. "Give glory to God by telling the truth," they said. "We know this man is a sinner."
He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know: I was blind but now I see!"
Then they asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"
He answered, "I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?"
Then they hurled insults at him and said, "You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses! We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from."
The man answered, "Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does his will. Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."
To this they replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!" And they threw him out.
Spiritual Blindness
Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
"Who is he, sir?" the man asked. "Tell me so that I may believe in him."
Jesus said, "You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you."
Then the man said, "Lord, I believe," and he bowed down before him.
Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind."
Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, "What? Are we blind too?"
Jesus said, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains."

John Chapter 10
The Good Shepherd and His Sheep
Amen, amen, I tell you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber. But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice. Jesus used this figure of speech, but the people did not understand what he was telling them.
Therefore Jesus said again, "Amen, amen, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them. I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out, and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.
I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me—just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep that are not of this sheepfold. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father."
Further Conflict Over Jesus's Claims
The Judeans who heard these words were again divided. Many of them said, "He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?" But others said, "These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"
Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the Temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade. The Judean leaders gathered around him, saying, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly."
Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father's name testify about me, but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. I and the Father are one."
Again his opponents picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus said to them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?"
"We are not stoning you for any good work," they replied, "but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God."
Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, 'I have said you are gods'? If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside—what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'? Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father. But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father." Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp.
Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. There he stayed, and many people came to him. They said, "Though John never performed a sign, all that John said about this man was true." And in that place many believed in him.

John 11
Lazarus Gets Sick
There was a man named Lazarus who lived in Bethany. He was sick. Bethany was the town where Mary and her sister Martha lived. (This is the same Mary who poured perfume on the Lord and dried his feet with her hair. Lazarus was her brother.)
The sisters sent word to Jesus, saying, "Lord, the one you love is sick."
When Jesus got the message, he said, "This sickness won't end in death. It will bring glory to God, so that the Son of God will be glorified through it." Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. But when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days.
After that, he said to his disciples, "Let's go back to Judea."
The disciples said, "Teacher, the Judeans were just trying to stone you. Are you really going back there?"
Jesus answered, "There are twelve hours of daylight, aren't there? If you walk during the day, you won't stumble because you can see by the light of this world. But if you walk at night, you stumble because there's no light."
After saying this, he told them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I'm going there to wake him up."
His disciples said, "Lord, if he's sleeping, he'll get better."
Jesus had been talking about Lazarus's death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.
So Jesus told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead. For your sake, I'm glad I wasn't there, so that you can believe. But let's go to him."
Then Thomas said to the other disciples, "Let's go too, so we can die with him."
Jesus Arrives in Bethany
When Jesus arrived, he found out that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem, and many Judeans had come to comfort Martha and Mary about their brother.
When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him. But Mary stayed at home.
Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died. But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask."
Jesus told her, "Your brother will rise again."
Martha said, "I know he'll rise again in the resurrection on the last day."
Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. Anyone who believes in me will live, even after dying. And everyone who lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?"
"Yes, Lord," she said. "I believe you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who was coming into the world."
After saying this, she went back and quietly called her sister Mary. "The Teacher is here," she said, "and he's asking for you." When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. Jesus hadn't entered the village yet. He was still at the place where Martha had met him. The Judeans who had been comforting Mary in the house saw her get up quickly and leave. They followed her, thinking she was going to the tomb to cry there.
Jesus Weeps
When Mary got to the place where Jesus was, she saw him and fell at his feet. She said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died."
When Jesus saw her crying, and the Judeans who came with her crying too, he was deeply troubled. "Where have you put him?" he asked.
"Come and see, Lord," they said.
Jesus cried.
The Judeans said, "Look how much he loved him!"
But some of them said, "He opened the eyes of the blind man. Couldn't he have kept this man from dying?"
Jesus Raises Lazarus From the Dead
Jesus was deeply troubled again as he came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone covering the entrance. "Remove the stone," he said.
Martha, the dead man's sister, said, "But Lord, there will be a terrible smell by now. He's been dead for four days."
Jesus said to her, "Didn't I tell you that if you believe, you'll see God's glory?"
So they removed the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, "Father, thank you for hearing me. I know you always hear me, but I said this for the sake of all these people standing here, so they'll believe you sent me."
After he said this, Jesus shouted, "Lazarus, come out!" The dead man came out with his hands and feet wrapped in burial cloths, and a cloth wrapped around his face.
Jesus told them, "Unwrap him and let him go."
The Plot to Kill Jesus
Many of the Judeans who had come to visit Mary saw what Jesus did and believed in him. But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. So the chief priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the council.
"What are we going to do?" they asked. "This man keeps performing miraculous signs. If we let him continue like this, everyone will believe in him. Then the Romans will come and destroy both our Temple and our nation."
One of them, a man named Caiaphas who was the high priest that year, said, "You don't understand anything! Don't you realize it's better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed?"
He didn't say this on his own. As high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation. And not only for that nation, but also to bring together all of God's scattered children and make them one. From that day on, they planned to kill him.
Because of this, Jesus stopped moving around publicly among the people of Judea. He went to a town near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples.
The Jewish Passover was coming soon, and many people went up to Jerusalem from the countryside to go through the purification ceremonies before Passover. They kept looking for Jesus. As they stood in the Temple area, they asked each other, "What do you think? Will he come to the festival or not?" The chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where Jesus was, they should report it so they could arrest him.

John Chapter 12
Mary Anoints Jesus at Bethany
Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived—the man Jesus had raised from the dead. They gave a dinner there in Jesus's honor. Martha served the meal, and Lazarus was one of the people eating with Jesus. Mary took about a pint of expensive perfume made from pure nard and poured it on Jesus's feet. Then she wiped his feet with her hair. The whole house was filled with the smell of the perfume.
But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who would later betray him, complained, "Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a whole year's wages." He didn't say this because he cared about the poor. He said it because he was a thief. As keeper of the money bag, he used to steal from it.
Jesus said, "Leave her alone. She was keeping this perfume for the day of my burial. You'll always have the poor with you, but you won't always have me."
A large crowd of Judeans found out that Jesus was there. They came not only to see Jesus but also to see Lazarus, the man he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus too, because many of the Judeans were going over to Jesus and believing in him because of Lazarus.
The Triumphal Entry
The next day, the huge crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of THE LORD! Blessed is the King of Israel!"
Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written: "Don't be afraid, Daughter Zion. Look, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey's colt." His disciples didn't understand this at first. But after Jesus was glorified, they remembered that these things had been written about him and that these things had happened to him.
The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead kept telling everyone about it. Many people went out to meet Jesus because they heard he had done this miraculous sign. The Pharisees said to each other, "Look, we're getting nowhere. The whole world has gone after him!"
Jesus Predicts His Death
There were some Greeks among the people who had come to worship at the festival. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, "Sir, we want to see Jesus." Philip went and told Andrew. Then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.
Jesus said, "The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. I tell you the truth, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it stays just a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. Anyone who loves their life will lose it. But anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If you serve me, you must follow me. Where I am, my servant will be also. My Father will honor anyone who serves me.
Now my soul is troubled. What should I say? 'Father, save me from this time of suffering'? No, this is the very reason I came to this time. Father, bring glory to your name!"
Then a voice came from heaven: "I have brought glory to it, and I will bring glory to it again." The crowd standing there heard it and said it had thundered. Others said an angel had spoken to him.
Jesus said, "That voice wasn't for my benefit—it was for yours. Now is the time for judgment on this world. Now the ruler of this world will be thrown out. And when I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all people to myself." He said this to show what kind of death he was going to die.
The crowd said, "We've heard from the Law that the Messiah will live forever. So how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?"
Jesus told them, "The light will be with you just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness catches up with you. Anyone who walks in the dark doesn't know where they're going. Put your trust in the light while you have it, so you can become children of light." After Jesus said this, he left and hid from them.
Belief and Unbelief Among the People
Even after Jesus had done so many miraculous signs in front of them, they still wouldn't believe in him. This fulfilled what the prophet Isaiah had said: "Lord, who has believed our message? Who has seen the Lord's power?"
This is why they couldn't believe. Isaiah also said: "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so they can't see with their eyes or understand with their hearts or turn to me—and I would heal them." Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus's glory and spoke about him.
Even so, many of the leaders believed in him. But because they were afraid of the Pharisees, they wouldn't admit it publicly. They were afraid of being thrown out of the synagogue. They loved praise from people more than praise from God.
Jesus Summarizes His Message
Then Jesus said loudly, "Anyone who believes in me isn't just believing in me, but in the one who sent me. Anyone who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me. I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me will stay in darkness.
If anyone hears my words but doesn't obey them, I don't judge that person. I didn't come to judge the world but to save the world. There is a judge for anyone who rejects me and doesn't accept my words. The very words I've spoken will judge them on the last day. I haven't spoken on my own authority. The Father who sent me told me what to say and how to say it. I know that his commands lead to eternal life. So everything I say is exactly what the Father has told me to say."

John Chapter 13
Jesus Washes His Disciples' Feet
Just before the Passover Festival, Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go back to the Father. He had loved his followers who were in the world, and he loved them all the way to the end.
The evening meal was being served. The devil had already put the idea into Judas Iscariot's mind to betray Jesus. (Judas was the son of Simon.) Jesus knew that the Father had put everything under his control. He knew he had come from God and was going back to God. So he got up from the meal, took off his outer robe, and wrapped a towel around his waist. Then he poured water into a bowl and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"
Jesus answered, "You don't understand now what I'm doing, but you will understand later."
Peter said, "No! You will never wash my feet!"
Jesus replied, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."
Then Simon Peter said, "Lord, then don't just wash my feet—wash my hands and my head too!"
Jesus answered, "People who have had a bath only need to wash their feet. Their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you." He said this because he knew who was going to betray him. That's why he said not everyone was clean.
After he finished washing their feet, he put his robe back on and sat down again. "Do you understand what I've done for you?" he asked them. "You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and you're right, because that's what I am. I'm your Lord and Teacher, and I've washed your feet. So you should wash each other's feet. I've given you an example. You should do what I've done for you. I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master. A messenger isn't greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you'll be blessed if you do them.
Jesus Predicts His Betrayal
I'm not talking about all of you. I know the ones I've chosen. But this will fulfill what Scripture says: 'The one who shared my bread has turned against me.' I'm telling you this now, before it happens, so that when it does happen, you'll believe that I am he. I tell you the truth, anyone who accepts someone I send accepts me. And anyone who accepts me accepts the one who sent me."
After saying this, Jesus became very troubled. He said, "I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me."
His disciples looked at each other, wondering which one of them he was talking about. One of them, the disciple Jesus loved, was sitting next to him. Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, "Ask him who he's talking about."
This disciple leaned back against Jesus and asked him, "Lord, who is it?"
Jesus answered, "It's the one I give this piece of bread to after I dip it in the dish." Then he dipped the piece of bread and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered him.
Jesus told him, "What you're about to do, do it quickly." But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him. Since Judas was in charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what they needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor. As soon as Judas took the bread, he left. It was night.
The New Commandment
After Judas left, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him right away.
My children, I'll only be with you a little longer. You'll look for me, and just as I told the Judean leaders, I'm telling you now: Where I'm going, you can't come.
I'm giving you a new command: Love each other. Just as I have loved you, you must love each other. This is how everyone will know you're my disciples—if you love each other."
Jesus Predicts Peter's Denial
Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?"
Jesus answered, "Where I'm going, you can't follow me now. But you'll follow me later."
Peter asked, "Lord, why can't I follow you now? I'll lay down my life for you."
Jesus answered, "Will you really lay down your life for me? I tell you the truth, before the rooster crows, you'll deny three times that you even know me!"

John Chapter 14
Jesus Comforts His Disciples
"Don't let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God, and trust in me too. There are many rooms in my Father's house. If that weren't true, would I have told you that I'm going there to prepare a place for you? If I go and prepare a place for you, I'll come back and take you to be with me. Then you'll be where I am. You know the way to the place where I'm going."
Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you're going. So how can we know the way?"
Jesus answered, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you'll know my Father too. From now on, you do know him and have seen him."
Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father. That will be enough for us."
Jesus answered, "Philip, I've been with you all this time, and you still don't know me? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. So how can you say, 'Show us the Father'? Don't you believe that I'm in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I say to you don't come from my own authority. It's the Father living in me who does his work. Believe me when I say that I'm in the Father and the Father is in me. Or at least believe because of the miraculous works you've seen.
I tell you the truth, anyone who believes in me will do the same works I've been doing. They'll do even greater things than these, because I'm going to the Father. I'll do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father will be glorified in the Son. You can ask me for anything in my name, and I'll do it.
Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit
If you love me, obey my commands. I'll ask the Father, and he'll give you another Helper to be with you forever—the Spirit of truth. The world can't accept him, because it doesn't see him or know him. But you know him, because he lives with you and will be in you. I won't leave you like orphans. I'll come to you. In a little while, the world won't see me anymore, but you'll see me. Because I live, you'll live too. On that day you'll know that I'm in my Father, you're in me, and I'm in you. Anyone who has my commands and obeys them is the one who loves me. Anyone who loves me will be loved by my Father. I'll love them too and show myself to them."
Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, "Lord, why are you going to show yourself to us and not to the world?"
Jesus answered, "Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we'll come to them and make our home with them. Anyone who doesn't love me won't obey my teaching. The words you're hearing aren't my own—they belong to the Father who sent me.
I've told you all this while I'm still with you. But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything. He'll remind you of everything I've told you. I'm leaving you with peace. I'm giving you my peace. I don't give to you the way the world gives. Don't let your hearts be troubled, and don't be afraid.
You heard me say, 'I'm going away, and I'm coming back to you.' If you loved me, you'd be glad I'm going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am. I've told you this now before it happens, so that when it does happen, you'll believe. I won't talk with you much longer, because the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me. But the world must learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father commands me to do.
Get up. Let's leave this place."

John Chapter 15
The Vine and the Branches
"I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch in me that doesn't produce fruit. But every branch that does produce fruit, he trims back so it will produce even more fruit. You're already clean because of the word I've spoken to you. Stay connected to me, and I'll stay connected to you. A branch can't produce fruit by itself—it has to stay connected to the vine. In the same way, you can't produce fruit unless you stay connected to me.
I am the vine. You are the branches. If you stay connected to me and I stay connected to you, you'll produce a lot of fruit. Apart from me, you can't do anything. If anyone doesn't stay connected to me, they're like a branch that gets thrown away and dries up. Those branches are gathered up, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you stay connected to me and my words stay in you, ask for whatever you want, and it will be given to you. This brings glory to my Father—that you produce a lot of fruit and show that you're my disciples.
The Father has loved me, and I have loved you in the same way. Now stay in my love. If you obey my commands, you'll stay in my love, just as I've obeyed my Father's commands and stay in his love. I've told you this so that my joy will be in you and your joy will be complete. This is my command: Love each other the way I've loved you. There's no greater love than this—to lay down your life for your friends. You're my friends if you do what I command you. I don't call you servants anymore, because a servant doesn't know what his master is doing. Instead, I've called you friends, because everything I've learned from my Father, I've made known to you. You didn't choose me—I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce fruit, fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. This is my command: Love each other.
The World's Hatred
If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as one of its own. But you don't belong to the world. I've chosen you out of the world, and that's why the world hates you. Remember what I told you: 'A servant isn't greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they'll persecute you too. If they obeyed my teaching, they'll obey yours too. They'll treat you this way because of my name, because they don't know the one who sent me.
If I hadn't come and spoken to them, they wouldn't be guilty of sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin. Anyone who hates me hates my Father too. If I hadn't done the works among them that no one else has done, they wouldn't be guilty of sin. But they've seen these works, and yet they've hated both me and my Father. This fulfills what's written in their Law: 'They hated me without any reason.'
When the Helper comes—the one I'll send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father—he'll testify about me. And you'll testify too, because you've been with me from the beginning."

John Chapter 16
The Work of the Holy Spirit
"I've told you these things so you won't fall away. They'll throw you out of the synagogues. In fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they're doing God a service. They'll do these things because they don't know the Father or me. I'm telling you this now so that when it happens, you'll remember I warned you. I didn't tell you this from the beginning because I was with you then.
Now I'm going to the one who sent me. None of you is asking me, 'Where are you going?' Instead, your hearts are filled with sadness because of what I've told you. But I'm telling you the truth—it's better for you that I go away. Unless I go away, the Helper won't come to you. But if I go, I'll send him to you. When he comes, he'll prove the world wrong about sin, about what's right, and about judgment. He'll prove them wrong about sin because they don't believe in me. He'll prove them wrong about what's right because I'm going to the Father and you won't see me anymore. And he'll prove them wrong about judgment because the ruler of this world has already been condemned.
I have much more to tell you, but you can't handle it right now. But when the Spirit of truth comes, he'll guide you into all truth. He won't speak on his own. He'll only speak what he hears, and he'll tell you what's going to happen. He'll bring glory to me because he'll take what is mine and make it known to you. Everything that belongs to the Father is mine. That's why I said the Spirit will take what is mine and make it known to you."
The Disciples' Grief Will Turn to Joy
"In a little while you won't see me anymore. Then after a little while, you'll see me again."
Some of his disciples said to each other, "What does he mean by saying, 'In a little while you won't see me, and then after a little while you'll see me again,' and 'Because I'm going to the Father'?" They kept asking, "What does he mean by 'a little while'? We don't understand what he's saying."
Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, "Are you asking each other what I meant when I said, 'In a little while you won't see me, and then after a little while you'll see me again'? I'm telling you the truth—you'll cry and mourn while the world celebrates. You'll be sad, but your sadness will turn into joy. When a woman is giving birth, she has pain because her time has come. But when her baby is born, she forgets the pain because of her joy that a child has been born into the world. It's the same with you. Right now you're sad, but I'll see you again. Then you'll be filled with joy, and no one will take that joy away from you.
On that day, you won't need to ask me for anything. I'm telling you the truth—my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now, you haven't asked for anything in my name. Ask and you'll receive, so that your joy will be complete.
I Have Overcome the World
I've been speaking to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I won't use figures of speech anymore. Instead, I'll tell you plainly about the Father. On that day, you'll ask in my name. I'm not saying I'll ask the Father on your behalf, because the Father himself loves you. He loves you because you've loved me and have believed that I came from God. I came from the Father and entered the world. Now I'm leaving the world and going back to the Father."
Then his disciples said, "Now you're speaking clearly, not using figures of speech. Now we can see that you know everything and don't need anyone to ask you questions. This makes us believe you came from God."
Jesus answered, "Do you finally believe? Look, the time is coming—in fact, it's already here—when you'll be scattered. Each of you will go to your own home and leave me all alone. But I'm not really alone, because my Father is with me.
I've told you all this so that you can have peace in me. In this world, you'll have trouble. But be brave! I have defeated the world."

John Chapter 17
Jesus Prays for Himself
After Jesus said these things, he looked up toward heaven and prayed: "Father, the time has come. Bring glory to your Son so that your Son can bring glory to you. You've given him authority over all people so he can give eternal life to everyone you've given him. And this is eternal life—to know you, the only true God, and to know Jesus the Messiah, the one you sent. I've brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do. Now, Father, bring me into your glorious presence, the glory I had with you before the world was created.
Jesus Prays for His Disciples
I've revealed who you are to the people you gave me out of the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me. They've obeyed your word. Now they know that everything you've given me comes from you. I gave them the message you gave me, and they accepted it. They know for certain that I came from you, and they believe you sent me.
I'm praying for them. I'm not praying for the world, but for those you've given me, because they belong to you. Everything I have is yours, and everything you have is mine. I've been glorified through them. I'm not staying in the world any longer, but they're still in the world, and I'm coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name—the name you gave me—so they can be one, just as we are one. While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by your name. Not one of them has been lost, except the one who was destined for destruction, so that Scripture would be fulfilled.
Now I'm coming to you, but I'm saying these things while I'm still in the world so they can have the full measure of my joy in them. I've given them your word, and the world has hated them because they don't belong to the world, just as I don't belong to the world. I'm not asking you to take them out of the world, but to protect them from the evil one. They don't belong to the world, just as I don't belong to the world.
Make them holy by the truth. Your word is truth. Just as you sent me into the world, I've sent them into the world. I set myself apart for them, so they too can be set apart by the truth.
Jesus Prays for All Believers
I'm not praying only for them. I'm also praying for everyone who will believe in me through their message. I pray that all of them will be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us, so the world will believe that you sent me. I've given them the glory you gave me, so they can be one just as we are one—I in them and you in me. Then they'll be brought into complete unity, and the world will know that you sent me and have loved them just as you've loved me.
Father, I want those you've given me to be with me where I am. I want them to see my glory, the glory you gave me because you loved me before the world was created.
Righteous Father, the world doesn't know you, but I know you. And these people know that you sent me. I've made you known to them, and I'll continue to make you known. I do this so that the love you have for me will be in them, and so I myself will be in them."

John Chapter 18
Jesus Arrested in the Garden
When Jesus finished saying these things, he went out with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. There was a garden on the other side, and he and his disciples went into it.
Judas, who was betraying him, knew the place because Jesus had often met there with his disciples. So Judas came to the garden, leading a group of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and Pharisees. They were carrying lanterns, torches, and weapons.
Jesus knew everything that was about to happen to him. He stepped forward and asked them, "Who are you looking for?"
"Jesus of Nazareth," they answered.
"I am he," Jesus said. (Judas, the traitor, was standing there with them.) When Jesus said, "I am he," they stepped back and fell to the ground.
He asked them again, "Who are you looking for?"
They said, "Jesus of Nazareth."
Jesus answered, "I told you that I am he. If you're looking for me, let these other men go." This happened so the words he had spoken would come true: "I haven't lost one of those you gave me."
Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, pulled it out and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)
Jesus told Peter, "Put your sword away! Shouldn't I drink the cup the Father has given me?"
Peter's First Denial
Then the soldiers, their commander, and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They tied him up and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had told the Jewish leaders it would be good if one man died for the people.
Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple knew the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard. But Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who knew the high priest, came back and spoke to the servant girl on duty. Then he brought Peter inside.
The girl at the door asked Peter, "Aren't you one of this man's disciples too?"
He said, "I'm not."
It was cold, and the servants and officials were standing around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter was also standing with them, warming himself.
The High Priest Questions Jesus
Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
Jesus answered, "I've spoken openly to the world. I've always taught in synagogues and at the Temple, where all the Jews gather. I haven't said anything in secret. Why are you questioning me? Ask the people who heard me. They know what I said."
When Jesus said this, one of the officials standing nearby slapped him in the face. "Is this how you answer the high priest?" he demanded.
Jesus replied, "If I said something wrong, tell me what was wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you hit me?" Then Annas sent him, still tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest.
Peter's Second and Third Denials
Meanwhile, Simon Peter was still standing there, warming himself. So they asked him, "Aren't you one of his disciples too?"
He denied it, saying, "I'm not."
One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Didn't I see you with him in the garden?" Peter denied it again, and right then a rooster crowed.
Jesus Before Pilate
Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By this time it was early morning. To avoid ceremonial uncleanness, they didn't enter the palace because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?"
They answered, "If he weren't a criminal, we wouldn't have handed him over to you."
Pilate said, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law."
They said, "But we don't have the right to execute anyone." This happened to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die.
Pilate went back inside the palace, called for Jesus, and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"
Jesus asked, "Is that your own idea, or did others tell you about me?"
Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?"
Jesus said, "My kingdom doesn't belong to this world. If it did, my servants would fight to keep me from being arrested by the Jewish leaders. But my kingdom is from another place."
"So you are a king!" Pilate said.
Jesus answered, "You say that I'm a king. The reason I was born and came into the world is to tell the truth. Everyone who's on the side of truth listens to me."
"What is truth?" Pilate asked. After saying this, he went back out to the Jews gathered there and said, "I find no basis for any charge against him. But you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover. Do you want me to release 'the king of the Jews'?"
They shouted back, "No, not him! Give us Barabbas!" Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising.

John Chapter 19
Jesus Sentenced to Be Crucified
Then Pilate took Jesus and had him whipped. The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They dressed him in a purple robe and kept coming up to him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!" And they slapped him in the face.
Pilate came out again and said to the Jews gathered there, "Look, I'm bringing him out to you so you'll know that I find no basis for any charge against him." When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"
As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"
But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. I find no basis for a charge against him."
The Jewish leaders said, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die because he claimed to be the Son of God."
When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid. He went back inside the palace and asked Jesus, "Where do you come from?" But Jesus didn't answer him. "Won't you speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realize I have the power either to free you or to crucify you?"
Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it weren't given to you from above. So the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."
From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you're no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king is opposing Caesar."
When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place called the Stone Pavement. It was the day of Preparation of the Passover, about noon.
"Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews.
But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!"
"Should I crucify your king?" Pilate asked.
The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."
Finally, Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.
The Crucifixion of Jesus
So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place called the Skull. There they crucified him, and with him two others—one on each side with Jesus in the middle.
Pilate had a sign prepared and put on the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. Many of the Jews read this sign because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek. The chief priests protested to Pilate, "Don't write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews."
Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares, one for each of them. The undergarment was left over. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. "Let's not tear it," they said to each other. "Let's decide by lot who gets it." This happened so the Scripture would be fulfilled that said, "They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment." So that's what the soldiers did.
Near the cross stood Jesus's mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple he loved standing nearby, he said to her, "Woman, here is your son." Then he said to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.
The Death of Jesus
Later, knowing that everything was now finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I'm thirsty." A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a hyssop branch, and lifted it to Jesus's lips. When he had taken the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." Then he bowed his head and died.
Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was a special Sabbath. The Jewish leaders didn't want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, so they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. The soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then the legs of the other. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they didn't break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus's side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
The man who saw it has given his testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows he's telling the truth, and he testifies so you can believe too. These things happened so the Scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken," and, as another Scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced."
The Burial of Jesus
Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away. He was joined by Nicodemus, the man who had earlier visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. Taking Jesus's body, the two of them wrapped it with the spices in strips of linen, following Jewish burial customs. At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden was a new tomb where no one had ever been laid. Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.

John 20

The Empty Tomb
Early on Sunday morning, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb. She saw that the large stone had been moved away from the entrance. She ran to find Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved. She told them, "They've taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they've put him."
Peter and the other disciple headed for the tomb. They were both running, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and got there first. He bent down and looked in. He saw the linen burial cloths lying there, but he didn't go inside.
Then Simon Peter arrived and went straight into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there. He also saw the cloth that had been around Jesus's head. It wasn't lying with the other cloths—it was folded up by itself in a different place. Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went inside too. He saw this and believed. (They still didn't understand from the Scriptures that Jesus had to rise from the dead.) Then the disciples went back home.
Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene
Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she cried, she bent down to look into the tomb. She saw two angels dressed in white, sitting where Jesus's body had been—one at the head and one at the feet.
They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?"
She said, "They've taken my Lord away, and I don't know where they've put him." After she said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there. But she didn't realize it was Jesus.
Jesus asked her, "Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?"
She thought he was the gardener. She said, "Sir, if you've carried him away, tell me where you've put him, and I'll go get him."
Jesus said to her, "Mary."
She turned toward him and said, "Teacher!"
Jesus told her, "Don't hold on to me, because I haven't yet gone up to the Father. Go to my brothers and tell them, 'I'm going up to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news. She said, "I've seen the Lord!" And she told them everything he had said to her.
Jesus Appears to His Disciples
That same Sunday evening, the disciples were together in a house with the doors locked because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Suddenly, Jesus came and stood among them. He said, "Peace be with you." After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Lord.
Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. Just as the Father sent me, I'm now sending you." Then he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone's sins, they're forgiven. If you don't forgive them, they're not forgiven."
Jesus Appears to Thomas
Thomas, one of the twelve disciples (also called the Twin), wasn't with the others when Jesus came. The other disciples told him, "We've seen the Lord!"
But Thomas said, "I won't believe it unless I see the nail marks in his hands, put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side."
Eight days later, the disciples were in the house again, and this time Thomas was with them. Even though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them. He said, "Peace be with you."
Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here and look at my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe."
Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!"
Jesus said to him, "You believe because you've seen me. Blessed are those who believe without seeing me."
The Purpose of This Book
Jesus did many other miraculous signs in front of his disciples that aren't written in this book. But these are written so you can believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God. And by believing in him, you can have life through his name.

John 21
Jesus Appears to Seven Disciples
Later, Jesus appeared again to his disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. This is how it happened.
Simon Peter, Thomas (also called the Twin), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were all together. Simon Peter said to them, "I'm going fishing."
They said, "We'll go with you." They went out and got into the boat, but that night they didn't catch anything.
Early the next morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples didn't realize it was him. Jesus called out to them, "Friends, do you have any fish?"
"No," they answered.
He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat, and you'll find some." So they threw the net out, and then they couldn't pull it back in because there were so many fish.
The disciple Jesus loved said to Peter, "It's the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard him say, "It's the Lord," he put on his outer coat (he had taken it off to work) and jumped into the water. The other disciples followed in the boat, dragging the net full of fish behind them. They weren't far from shore—only about a hundred yards.
When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire with fish cooking on it, and some bread. Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you just caught."
Simon Peter went aboard and pulled the net to shore. It was full of large fish—one hundred fifty-three of them. Even with so many fish, the net didn't tear.
Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came, took the bread, and gave it to them. He did the same with the fish. This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.
Jesus Restores Peter
When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these others do?"
Peter said, "Yes, Lord. You know that I love you."
Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."
Jesus asked a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
Peter answered, "Yes, Lord. You know that I love you."
Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."
He asked a third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him a third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you."
Jesus said, "Feed my sheep. I'm telling you the truth—when you were younger, you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted. But when you're old, you'll stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you don't want to go." Jesus said this to show how Peter would die and bring glory to God. Then Jesus said to him, "Follow me."
Jesus and the Disciple He Loved
Peter turned around and saw the disciple Jesus loved following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and asked, "Lord, who's going to betray you?") When Peter saw him, he asked Jesus, "Lord, what about him?"
Jesus answered, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what's that to you? You must follow me." Because of this, a rumor spread among the believers that this disciple wouldn't die. But Jesus didn't say he wouldn't die. He only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what's that to you?"
This is the disciple who tells about these things and who wrote them down. We know that what he says is true.
Jesus did many other things too. If every one of them were written down, I don't think the whole world would have room for all the books that would be written.
